"""Shared path-safety exception for ticket ids used as filesystem path segments.

Both file-adapter modules that turn a ticket id into a filesystem path —
:mod:`~factory_console.file_adapter.ticket_md` and
:mod:`~factory_console.file_adapter.run_state` — raise the SAME
:class:`PathTraversal` from here, so the REST error code is uniform
(``invalid_ticket_id``, per ARCHITECTURE.md's run-state/id contract) and a single
``except PathTraversal`` at the edge layer catches every unsafe-id path rather
than only one module's copy.

    cause maps to the SAME transport contract (status 400, ``invalid_ticket_id``)
